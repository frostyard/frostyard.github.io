## Snowfield with Batteries Included

Snowfield Loaded combines the Surface-optimized linux-surface kernel with the same enterprise and developer applications found in Snow Loaded.

### Additional Applications

- **Microsoft Edge** — Chromium-based browser
- **Visual Studio Code** — Full VS Code editor
- **Bitwarden** — Desktop password manager
- **Incus** — Container and VM manager with QEMU/KVM and web UI
- **Azure VPN Client** — Microsoft Azure VPN connectivity

### When to Use Snowfield Loaded

Choose this image when you're running on Microsoft Surface hardware and want enterprise applications pre-installed. For a leaner Surface-optimized base, use standard Snowfield instead.

### Pulling the Image

```bash
podman pull ghcr.io/frostyard/snowfieldloaded:latest
```
