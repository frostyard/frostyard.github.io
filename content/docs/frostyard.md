## Stable Debian Base

Frostyard's desktop and server images aren't "based on" Debian. They ARE Debian. We just add extra touches to make Debian more friendly for an Atomic operating system with a read-only root filesystem.

## Tools Aren't An Afterthought

We've thought through all the pain points of immutable root filesystems and provided proven paths for you to get your work done.

You can get your favorite tools through a number of different channels:

- Homebrew
- Containers (Podman/Docker)
- Incus
- Flatpaks
- Snap
- [SystemD sysexts](/docs/extensions/)
